Feedback INF112 spring 2018 - Oblig.2

Group: Team NASA

Overall feedback
Very good delivery.
Especially good product specification, the plan for the next assignments seems very clear.
Overall good answers on most of the tasks.
Should have specified more about the team members. Some team-members roles were specified, but what
about the remaining team members?

Deliverable: Product specification
Very good delivery. It seems you have figured out the structure and design of the different
diagrams and so on. Will be easy to change in future assignments. Only comment is that the nonfunctional requirements could
be more specific.

Deliverable: Team plan
Good description of repo structure and so on, missing some team members when listing
roles and skills.

Deliverable: User manual
Most of the user manual was very good.

Deliverable: Project plan and process
Good description of plan, and of the chosen process for development.

Deliverable: Retrospective summary
Maybe a bit short, but good to see that there are few struggles.

Deliverable: Presentation
Very nice slides and good presentation overall. Presentation went a little bit over the time (not much, about 1 minute).

Team organization
It seems like the team structure is fine, but it is not specified good enough. There are also few commits by some
team members, even though they are listed in the meetings (also aware of the usage of google docs).
What did these team memebers do?

Score: 96.5 (of 100)
Evaluation: PASS
