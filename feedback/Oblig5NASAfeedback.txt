Feedback INF112 spring 2018 - Oblig.5

Group: Team NASA




Overall feedback:
Very good delivery. Good features added to the game and good documentation for the program.


Deliverable: Minutes/ meeting reports
As good as always.


Deliverable: Chess game + code quality
Very good delivery, nice features and online seems to be working for the most part. If you win a game of online chess
the game seems to freeze or crash. At least we could not figure out how to win a game without the game crashing when playing online.


Deliverable: Retrospective summary
Good, covers most of your struggles throughout the assignment.


Deliverable: User manual
The user manual seems mostly up to date with the game, but we are missing information about the additional features and modes
added to the game. You mention regular chess and chess 960, but not the online part, nor the other gamemodes. 


Deliverable: Presentation
Good slides and well presented.


Deliverable: Sequence diagram
Also a lot better then previous iterations. We were missing the updated version of the sequence diagram that you were told to
fix in the previous iterations (at least we could not find it), some points were deducted for this.


Deliverable: Design/class diagram
Everything seems to be on point for this delivery.


Score: 96.8 (of 100)

Evaluation: PASS

Very good delivery as always, hope you had fun working on this project, and good luck on the exam!
