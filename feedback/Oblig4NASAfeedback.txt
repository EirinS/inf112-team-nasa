Feedback INF112 spring 2018 - Oblig.3

Group: Team NASA




Overall feedback:
Very good delivery. Most of the previous errors have been fixed, and both the game and
the documentation is on mostly point.


Deliverable: Minutes/ meeting reports
Seems that you cover the things you should, good.


Deliverable: Chess game + code quality
Very good, seems to be fully functional with all desired features and so on.


Deliverable: Retrospective summary
Overall good, no comments for this.


Deliverable: License + trello/issue tracker/backlog
Still relevant and up to date. 


Deliverable: Presentation
Nice slides and good presentation overall.


Deliverable: Sequence diagram
This is a lot better than last time, at least for the multiplayer/singleplayer functinality. 
The one where you store the leaderboard is also good, but i'm lacking some kind of "actor/player" 
that is interacting with the leaderboard (e.g. when an "actor" ends a game, or wants to open
the leaderboard, then the things described in your sequence diagram will happen). 


Deliverable: Design/class diagram
This is also much better this time, most of the diagram is correct. Only comment to be made is
that the class diagram should only describe the logic of the game, not the
user interface. You might want to drop the "pure libgdx"/GUI classes, because these aren't 
necessary in a class diagram. 


Score: 97.8 (of 100)

Evaluation: PASS
