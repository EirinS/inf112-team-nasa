\begin{Large}\textbf{1.	Introduction}\\
\end{Large}
\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{1.1	Purpose}\\
\vspace{1mm}
This document specifies the software requirements and relevant informations related to the chess game application developed by TeamNASA. The document is intended to be read and reviewed by TeamNASA and interested parties.\\
\vspace{5mm}
\textbf{1.2	Scope}\\
\vspace{1mm}
The objective of the project is to develop a user friendly, robust and reliable multiplayer chess application, where a user can play against a machine player or another human player. The system offers three levels of intelligence such as novice, intermediate and expert level. The users can choose their preferred level of intelligence according to their chess skill.\\
\vspace{1mm}
Key features of the game:
\begin{itemize}
	

\item The system offers a user to choose either to play against another human player or a machine player.
\item The system offers three levels of intelligence to the user in the event the user choose to play against the machine player.
\item The system displays a 2D chessboard with visually appealing pieces and board layouts that follow standard rules of the chess game.
\item The system enables the valid moves for each chess pieces in the chess board.
\item The system displays necessary notifications during the chess game.   
\item The system record the results of each game played and provides ranking of each player based on number of games each players has won.


\end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}
\textbf{1.3	Overview}\\
\vspace{1mm}
The rest of the document elaborates the system requirements for the chess game.\\
\vspace{10mm}

\end{Large}
\vspace{3mm}
\textbf{2.1	Functional Requirements}\\
\begin{itemize}
	 
	\item The system offers the option to choose between a human player and a machine player
	\item The system provides a name registration function, which enables unique identification of each user. 
	\item The system upholds the uniqueness of user names. 
	\item The system offers the option to choose the level of intelligence.
	\item The system offers the option to choose the color of the pieces (White /Black).
	\item Displaying the chess board, nearest right hand side square is white.
	\item Displaying all 32 pieces in the correct positions.
	\item The system only allows a white piece to make the very first move in a game.
	\item Enable Pawn’s valid moves in the system.
	\item Enable Knight’s valid moves in the system.
	\item Enable Bishop’s valid moves in the system.
	\item Enable Rook’s valid moves in the system.
	\item Enable Queen’s valid moves in the system.
	\item Enable King’s valid moves in the system.
	\item Enable the functionality of castling in the game.
	\item Enable the functionality of En-passant move in the game.
	\item In an event of invalid move the system displays notification.
	\item In the event of “check”, “checkmate” and “stalemate” the system displays relevant notifications.
	\item The system offers the last move undo option.
	\item The system offers the option to quit the game anytime.   
	\item The system records all the moves from both players.
	\item Enable the time keeping functionality for each move.
	\item Displaying the captured pieces on both sides.
	\item Enable the points calculation for the entire chess game. Such as Win, draw, lose, each captured pieces and the moves.	
	\item The system keeps the win and loss results records of the games played.
	\item The system offers the ranking of players according to the level of intelligence. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2.2	Non Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reliability.
	\item Performance.
	\item Response time.
	\item Throughput.
	\item Maintainability.
	\item Scalability
\end{itemize}

\vspace{5mm}
\textbf{2.3	User Stories}\\
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item As a user I want a start menu so that I can choose to play against another human player or a machine player.
	\item As a user I want a menu so that I can choose between at least three intelligence levels of the machine player.
	\item As a user I want the program to have a 2D chessboard with visually appealing pieces and board layouts that follow standard rules of chess so that I can play a simulated game of chess.
	\item As a user I want the program to keep track of the results of each game so that the user can see a ranking of human players based on how many matches they have won.

	\item As a user I want the program to stop me from making illegal moves and to carry out legitimate features of standard chess rules.
	\item As a user I want the program to contain a timer to show how long a game has lasted.
	\item As a user I want the program to end a game of chess when a player is in checkmate.
	\item As a user I want the program to have a menu selection where I can get an overview of the game rules.

	Primary actor: Player\\
	\vspace{1mm}
	\textbf{Stakeholders and interests:}\\
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Player: Wants to play a game with an opponent. Only legal moves. Score should be saved. Time is kept track of.\\
	
		\item Opponent: Wants to play a game against player. Only legal moves. Score should be saved. Time is kept track of.\\
	
		\item High score holders: All scores are safely kept track of.
		
	\end{itemize}
