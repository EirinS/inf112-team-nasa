\section * {Summary}
We discussed in the team during our weekly meetings what went well and what we need to work on going forward. To sum up what went well, everyone was involved in the obligatory assignment, it was organized properly, everyone has done something and within the respected deadlines, and last but not least we had good communication between the meetings.

In general we have not encountered any major problems so far, but there’s always things we can work on. For the future assignments we would like to make the weekly meetings more effective; more planning pre-meetings. We would also like to go through all the completed tasks more properly to ensure higher quality rather than quantity.

For the next assignments going forward (3. - 5.), we would like to take a look at libGDX and Stockfish for AI.
