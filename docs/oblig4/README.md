# Regarding deliverable 8 & 9.
* We had some major issues with building the libGDX project through Gradle. (It works fine when we are running it!)
    * We got some ConcurrentModificationException errors that we could not bypass in any form or way. After some searching on the web we found instances of open Github Issues that were not resolved yet; we are assuming this is a bug.
* After talking with the TA's they suggested us to explicitly note this down.
